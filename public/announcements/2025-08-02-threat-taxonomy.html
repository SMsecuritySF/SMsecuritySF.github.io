  <h1>Call for Contributions: Threat Taxonomy</h1>
  <p><time datetime="2025-08-02">August 2, 2025</time></p>
  
  <p>The Smart Mobility Security Standardization Forum is developing a comprehensive threat taxonomy for smart mobility systems. We invite security researchers, industry practitioners, and domain experts to contribute their knowledge and experience to this critical initiative.</p>

  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>The threat taxonomy will serve as a foundational resource for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Identifying and categorizing security threats specific to smart mobility ecosystems</li>
    <li>Providing a common language for discussing mobility security risks</li>
    <li>Supporting risk assessment and mitigation planning processes</li>
    <li>Informing the development of security standards and best practices</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Contribution Areas</h2>
  <p>We are seeking contributions in the following areas:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Threat Identification:</strong> Novel or emerging threats to connected and autonomous vehicles</li>
    <li><strong>Attack Vectors:</strong> Detailed analysis of potential attack methods and entry points</li>
    <li><strong>Impact Assessment:</strong> Evaluation of threat consequences on safety, privacy, and operations</li>
    <li><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> Proven or proposed countermeasures and defensive techniques</li>
    <li><strong>Real-world Cases:</strong> Documented incidents and lessons learned from actual security events</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>
  <p>Contributions should be submitted by <strong>September 15, 2025</strong> through our secure portal. All submissions will be reviewed by our expert panel and incorporated into the taxonomy with appropriate attribution.</p>

  <p>For detailed submission guidelines and access to the contribution portal, please visit our <a href="https://contribute.smssf.org/taxonomy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contribution platform</a>.</p>
